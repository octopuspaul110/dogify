Welcome to the Dog Breed Classifier App!

This web application is designed to identify the breed of a dog using an InceptionV3(you can read more about the this model on [link](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=883ef823742cb051JmltdHM9MTY4MDczOTIwMCZpZ3VpZD0xNzE3N2Y5NC1iOTk1LTZhNGMtMDgwNy02ZWFmYjhkODZiNDMmaW5zaWQ9NTM3Mg&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=17177f94-b995-6a4c-0807-6eafb8d86b43&psq=inceptionv3+paper&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9hcnhpdi5vcmcvcGRmLzE1MTIuMDA1NjcucGRm&ntb=1)) model trained on over 10,000 images of 120 different dog breeds. The model has a 100% train and validation score, meaning it has been trained to accurately classify each breed.
Data used for this project was downloaded from kaggle (you can find it at [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data)),i had first developed the app using pytorch adopting pytorch-lightning with and without batchnormalization technique and transfer learning but later stuck with tensorflow as it performed better.
I have designed this app to be user-friendly and easy to use, with a simple and intuitive interface that allows for quick and easy classification of dog breeds.
instructions on how to use the app is on the app.
i have also included akc(American Kennel Clud),a website that has insighful information about your dog breed,just click the link after your dog breed has been predicted.
I hope you enjoy using this Dog Breed Classifier App and find it helpful in identifying the breed of the dogs in your life and learning somethings about your dog.
